# ATMega328P-Pacman
The program initializes the ADC and creates four custom characters for a PacMan animation. It then enters an infinite loop that displays the strings "Hello" and "Mr PacMan" on the LCD, followed by the PacMan animation in a loop that goes back and forth. The speed of the animation is controlled by the value read from the ADC input 0, which determines the delay between each step of the animation.
